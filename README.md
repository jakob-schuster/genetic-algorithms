# ðŸ¦  genetic algorithms

A tiny example translated to Rust from [Dan Shiffman's Nature of Code example](https://natureofcode.com/genetic-algorithms/).

Starts with a population of random strings, and evolves them over time to become more similar to a target string provided by the user. A better explanation can be found at the link above!
