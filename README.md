# genetic algorithms ðŸ¦ 

A tiny example translated to Rust from [Dan Shiffman's Nature of Code example](https://natureofcode.com/genetic-algorithms/).

Starts with a population of random strings, and evolves them over time to become more similar to a target string provided by the user. A better explanation can be found at the link above!

Hoping to add more to this repo, and turn it into a garden similar to the [language scrapyard](https://github.com/jakob-schuster/language-scrapyard).
